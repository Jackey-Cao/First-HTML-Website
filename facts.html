      <li>
        <p1>1. It's Warped</p1>
        <p2>
          The Milky Way is a disk that measures about 120,000 light 
          years across, with a central bulge that has a diameter of about 
          12,000 light years. The disk is not perfectly flat though, it is 
          warped due to our neighboring galaxies Large and Small Magellanic 
          clouds. These two galaxies have been pulling on the matter in our 
          galaxy like a game of tug-of-war.
        </p2>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p1>2. It has an invisible halo.</p1>
        <p2>
          Our galaxy is made up of about 90% dark matter, matter that 
          cannot be seen, and about 10% “luminous matter”, or matter that 
          we can see with our eyes. This large quantity of dark matter 
          causes an invisible halo that has been demonstrated by simulations 
          of how the Milky Way spins. If the dark matter did not exist then 
          the stars within the Milky Way would orbit much slower than has 
          been observed.
        </p2>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p1>3. It has over 200 billion stars.</p1>
        <p2>
          The Milky Way is only a medium sized galaxy with an estimated 
          200 billion stars. The largest galaxy we know of is called IC 1101 
          and has over 100 trillion stars.
        </p2>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p1>4. It’s really dusty and gassy.</p1>
        <p2>
          About 10-15% of the Milky Way’s visible matter is made of dust 
          and gas, with the rest being stars. On a clear night, the dusty 
          ring of the Milky Way can be seen in the night sky.
        </p2>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p1>5. It was made from other galaxies.</p1>
        <p2>
          In order for the Milky Way to achieve its current size and 
          shape it has consumed other galaxies throughout its history. 
          Our galaxy is currently consuming the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy 
          by adding the smaller galaxy’s stars to its own spiral.
        </p2>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p1>6. We can’t take pictures of it.</p1>
        <p2>
          Since we are located about 26,000 light years from the Milky 
          Way’s center we cannot take pictures of the disk. Any representation 
          that you have ever seen of our galaxy is either a different spiral 
          galaxy or what an artist thinks it might look like.
        </p2>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p1>7. There is a black hole at the center.</p1>
        <p2>
          Like most larger galaxies, the Milky Way has a supermassive black 
          hole at its center called Sagittarius A*. This black hole has an 
          estimated diameter of 14 million miles, which does not include the 
          disk of mass being drawn into it. This outer disk has about 14.6 
          million times the mass of our Sun in what would be similar to the 
          orbit of the Earth!
        </p2>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p1>8. It’s almost as old as the Universe itself.</p1>
        <p2>
          Scientists estimate that the Universe is about 13.7 billion years 
          old and that the Milky Way is about 13.6 billion years old. Although 
          the main parts of the galaxy were formed in the early days of the Universe, 
          the disk and the bulge did not fully form until about 10-12 billion years ago.
        </p2>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p1>9. It’s part of the Virgo Supercluster, a group of galaxies within 150 million light years.</p1>
        <p2>
          The Virgo Supercluster contains at least 100 galaxy groups and clusters, and 
          is about 110 million light-years in diameter. A 2014 study shows that the Virgo 
          Supercluster is only one lobe of a greater supercluster called Laniakea.
