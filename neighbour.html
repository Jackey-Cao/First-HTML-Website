        <img class="wordcontent" > The Andromeda Galaxy, or M31, is the 
        nearest large neighbor of our Milky Way, though it sits some 2.5 
        million light-years away. That makes it the most distant object 
        regularly visible with the naked eye. By some estimates, the 
        Andromeda Galaxy contains roughly one trillion stars and it 
        stretches more than 200,000 light-years in diameter. That’s 
        significantly bigger than the Milky Way, recent estimates 
        suggest is 150,000 light-years across. The oldest known discovery 
        of the Andromeda Galaxy dates to 964 A.D., when a Persian 
        astronomer named Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi wrote a book about “Fixed Stars.” 
        The Andromeda Galaxy was referred to as a “small cloud” in the heavens.

        <img class="wordcontent">Messier 32, or M32 is a dwarf elliptical galaxy located 
        in the constellation of Andromeda. It's a satellite of the famous 
        and much larger Andromeda Galaxy (M31) and was the first elliptical 
        galaxy ever observed.At a distance of about 2.65 million light-years, 
        M32 is 110,000 light-years further from us than M31. Like most 
        elliptical galaxies it contains mostly old red and yellow stars with 
        practically no dust or gas, implying no current star formation. However, 
        it has shown hints of star formation in the relatively recent past. 
        Locating M32 is as easy as locating the Andromeda Galaxy, which is 
        positioned northeast of the Great Square of Pegasus.
