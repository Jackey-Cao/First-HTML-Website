          The Milky Way is the galaxy that includes our Solar System, with 
          the name describing the galaxy's appearance from Earth: a hazy band of 
          light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually 
          distinguished by the naked eye.
        </p1>

          It is estimated to contain 100â€“400 billion stars and at least that number 
          of planets. The Solar System is located at a radius of about 27,000 light-years 
          (8.3 kpc) from the Galactic Center, on the inner edge of the Orion Arm, one of the 
          spiral-shaped concentrations of gas and dust. The stars in the innermost 10,000 light-years 
          form a bulge and one or more bars that radiate from the bulge.

          The Milky Way as a whole is moving at a velocity of approximately 600 km per 
          second with respect to extragalactic frames of reference. The oldest stars in the 
          Milky Way are nearly as old as the Universe itself and thus probably formed shortly 
          after the Dark Ages of the Big Bang.
